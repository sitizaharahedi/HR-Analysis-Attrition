## üß† Data Storytelling
Attrition appears most concentrated within critical talent pools. For instance, while the 35‚Äì44 age group makes up the bulk of the workforce, the 25‚Äì34 group is leaving at a faster rate. Departments like R&D are particularly vulnerable, contributing over half of all attrition cases, signaling potential engagement or workload challenges. Additionally, high attrition from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds may affect knowledge retention in specialized roles. Notably, Laboratory Technicians show a wide spread in job satisfaction scores, suggesting varying employee experiences within the same role.

This analysis can guide HR in developing targeted retention strategies, improving satisfaction, and addressing high-risk departments.
